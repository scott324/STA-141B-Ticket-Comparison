# STA-141B-Ticket-Comparison
Comparing between Seat Geek, Vivid Seats, and Ticketmaster

Graphs and some numerical results available in Visualizations and 141BGraphs.  
For the data from all three websites, matched by game, see combine_games.  
For the data from each website, seatgeek_events contains the results from Seat Geek, vividseats_lakers_events contains the results from Vivid Seats, and lakers_remaining_games_with_min_price contains the results from Ticketmaster.  
For the original code that was used to create these tables, SeatgeekAnalyis was used for the Seat Geek, vividseatsAnalysis was used for Vivid Seats, and ticketmasterlakers was used for Ticketmaster. Note that to run the code yourself, you will need an API key for Seat Geek and for Ticketmaster. Also, the results are no longer fully reproducible, since events that have taken place since this project will no longer appear.
